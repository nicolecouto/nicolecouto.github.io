  Whenever you have water flowing over the bottom of the ocean, there's friction at the interface between water and rock/sand/mud/whatever it's made of. That friction slows down the current and creates some turbulence near the bottom, which mixes up the water. We want to understand how much of that frictional drag exists for a couple reasons: 1) When water mixes it affects the energy, heat, and salt budgets of a given area of the ocean. Physical oceanographers like to keep tabs of where energy is going in and coming out. Energy comes in mostly from the sun and tides and it gets dissipated through mixing. 2) To get the global models right, we like to keep track of the major forces working on different parts of the ocean. In the Bering Strait, there's a pressure difference ($\rho g H \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}) that pushes water northward and winds ($\Tau_w$) that can push it either north or south. There's also friction at the bottom ($\Tau_b$) that slows the current down. There are some other forces too, but those are the big ones and if you get them right, you can model the flow through Bering Strait pretty well.

We wanted to measure how much friction is active at the bottom of Bering Strait. We did not have a friction-ometer, but we did have instruments that measured current velocity and turbulence. Since friction slows the current down and creates mixing near the bottom, we could work backwards from either the current profile or the mixing profile to figure out how much drag there is at the seafloor. We did both. We looked at how much turbulence there was near the bottom and did the math to figure out how much friction would lead to that. And we did the same sort of thing with the current speed - did the math to figure out how much friction would cause the observed decrease in current speed near the bottom. Luckily, both numbers were pretty similar! And the number was smaller than what people typically use to model this area. So, with this tiny contribution to science, it our my hope that maybe someday people will use this new drag coefficient and be able to model the flow through Bering Strait in a slightly more accurate way.
