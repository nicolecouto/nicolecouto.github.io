title:  "Palmer LTER"
teaser: "During my PhD, I spent a total of 12 months over 4 seasons working at Palmer Station, Antarctica, or at sea nearby on the R/V Laurence M Gould. My PhD advisor, Oscar Schofield, is one of the Principal Investigators of the <a href='pal.lternet.edu'>Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Project</a>, which began in 1993 with the goal of understanding the long-term trends of the West Antarctic Peninsula  coastal ocean ecosystem."

    While I consider myself a physical oceanographer, I spent a quite bit of time at Palmer pretending to be a biologist. Oscar is in charge of the phytoplankton component of the program which includes a long time series of biological sampling.

    At Palmer, we go out twice a week on our trusty Zodiac research platform, Bruiser, and collect water samples. We bring water from several depths back to the lab and measure phytoplankton biomass, rates of primary production, and phytoplankton health. We also measure the physical and optical properties of the water column so we can relate the physical environment to the biology.
