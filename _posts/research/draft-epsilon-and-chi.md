I started as a postdoc in the Multiscale Ocean Dynamics group at Scripps in September of 2017 and quickly went to work on a dataset from the Bering Strait that had been collected two years earlier.

The data files I opened up had some familiar variable names, "temp" for sea water temperature, "sal" for salinity, "pres" for pressure, "fluor" for fluorescence. But then there were some mysteries: "eps", "chi". I was at a loss.

Luckily, at the time, I knew so little about the world of ocean mixing, that I didn't find it embarrassing at all to ask my advisor what these variable names represented. As I quickly learned, they are ubiquitous in the mixing community. It did still take me a while to really understand their meaning, why they were useful, and how they were different from one another. This blog post is my attempt to distill this information in a way that might have saved me hours of reading had I come across it a year ago.
