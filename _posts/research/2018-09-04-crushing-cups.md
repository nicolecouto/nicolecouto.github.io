Today we completed perhaps the funnest of the deployments we'll do on this cruise - the Styrocast. Preparation is simple: decorate a Styrofoam cup with a Sharpie. Execution is even simpler: let the ocean do its work.

On one of our 2000 m CTD casts, we tied a mesh bag filled with the cups to the CTD rosette. They returned to the surface squished from all the ocean pressure they'd experienced at depth!

I, unable to boast any real artistic talent, appreciate how forgiving a medium soon-to-be-crushed styrofoam cups are. Mistakes are shrunk beyond noticeability and what's left is just plain cute.
