It's typical before the deepest CTD cast on a research cruise to see a stack of styrofoam cups and a collection of colorful sharpies appear in the common space. Scientists take a break from work to indulge their inner artists and prepare for the *styrocast*. We decorate our styrofoam cups with images from the trip, geometric patterns, quick notes to our loved ones, or really anything that pops into our heads. This time we had everything from Wave Gliders to polar bears to poop emojis.

For those like me who are not particularly skilled at drawing, the styrofoam cup is a very forgiving medium. Attached to the CTD frame, the cups descend thousands of meters below the sea surface, shrinking as the air pockets in the foam are crushed away by the water pressure, any mistakes made in the design becoming so small they're hardly visible.

On this cruise, our deepest CTD cast happened to be on day four, so we'll have these cute little decorations to brighten up our workspace for the rest of the trip.
